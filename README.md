- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leewelch-cloud
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
- ðŸŒ©Building and deploying serverless applications
- Securing cloud environments (because who doesnâ€™t love a good IAM policy?)
- Automating infrastructure with tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform
- Learning new things every dayâ€”because tech waits for no one
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
- AWS DevOps best practices
- Monitoring + alerting with CloudWatch
- CloudFront, Amplify, and all things static hosting
- GitHub Actions & CI/CD workflows
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:  welch1.megan@gmail.com or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-link-here) (Let me know you came from GitHub!)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun Fact: Iâ€™ve spent years excelling in healthcare sales, but my heartâ€™s in tech. Now Iâ€™m bridging both worldsâ€”bringing people-first communication into the cloud space.
